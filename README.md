# shutdown_timer
You can use this GUI tool to shutdown or restart your computer.

## NB
1. The Python Script as well as executable with GUI designed using TKinter library has been made available.
2. The code is well documented so you can adapt as well as extend to suit your needs.
3. Your Antivirus may detect the program as a virus and quarantine. It is clean and straight forward, you can inspect the code and compile an executable yourself.

## Steps
1. Run the tool (shutdown_timer.exe)
2. Specify when you want the system to Re-start or Shutdown in Seconds.
3. Click the appropriate button
4. If you need to cancel the operation click the Abort button

# TODO
Add other common computer tasks. The idea is simply interacting with the Windows API from Python to get things done faster.
